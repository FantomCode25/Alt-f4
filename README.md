# Decentralized, Secure, and Patient-Controlled Health Records

## Problem Statement

In healthcare today, several critical challenges hinder efficient patient care and data management:
- **Emergency Delays:** Doctors spend valuable time verifying patient records during emergencies.
- **Fragmented Records:** Paper-based and isolated databases restrict access to comprehensive patient information.
- **Security Risks:** Data breaches expose millions of health records annually, compromising patient privacy.
- **Lack of Interoperability:** Existing standards like FHIR and HL7 fail to ensure seamless data sharing across systems.
- **Limited Patient Control:** Patients lack control over their health records, impacting decision-making and care continuity.

## Solution Overview

Our project aims to address these challenges by developing a decentralized platform for managing health records. This platform empowers patients with secure, easy-to-access health records while ensuring interoperability and data privacy.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Storage:** Utilize blockchain technology for secure, tamper-proof health record storage.
- **Patient Control:** Enable patients to manage and authorize access to their health data.
- **Interoperability:**  facilitate seamless data sharing across healthcare providers.
- **Security:** Employ robust encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect patient information.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive interface for easy navigation and management of health records.
